http://dogerocket.ajf.me/

Displays dogerocket between earth and moon, and a bitcoin address. Donations to that address move dogerocket closer to moon, because dogecoind is polled.

Poorly and quickly written (5s polling generating 3 RPC calls is bad :/), but might be useful to others cloning my site. Designed for dogecoin, but could work for bitcoin or litecoin too, since I believe their RPC APIs are the same.
